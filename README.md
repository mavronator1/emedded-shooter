First Person Shooter game developed for MBED LPC1768 microcontroller for Embedded Systems Project in second year of Electronic Engineering at University of Leeds. 

The player must navigate through a maze, fighting enemies and finally battling a 'boss' at the end of the maze. 

We take inspiration from classic 90s shooter games such as Wolfenstein3D, specifically using the [Raycasting](https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html) rendering techqinue to generate a pseudo-3D world.
