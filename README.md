# emedded-shooter

FPS game developed for ths mbed LPC1768 microcontroller for the 'Embedded Systems Project' module in the second year of Electronic Engineering at University of Leeds. 

The game takes inspiration from classic 90s shooter games such as Wolfenstein3D, where the player must navigate through a pseudo-3D maze world, battling enemies and facing off with a 'boss' enemy at the end of the level. As done in retro shooter games, we use the [Raycasting](https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html) rendering techqinue to generate our 3D looking world that can run on a small, low power microcontroller.
